1. PostgreSQL Database Setup
Will it connect on its own?

Yes, your application will connect to the PostgreSQL database automatically if the database is running and the connection details (host, port, username, password, database name) are correctly configured in your .env file.
The connection is managed by the ORM (e.g., Sequelize) or the database library you're using.
What do I put in as the host, name, and everything?

Host: Use localhost if the database is running on the same machine. If it's hosted elsewhere (e.g., on a cloud service), use the database's IP address or URL.
Port: Use 5432 (default for PostgreSQL) unless you've configured it differently.
Database Name: Use the name of the database you created (e.g., org_management).
Username: Use the username you created for the database (e.g., postgres or a custom user).
Password: Use the password for the database user.
Where do I configure this?

In your .env file:
DB_HOST=localhost
DB_PORT=5432
DB_NAME=org_management
DB_USER=your_database_user
DB_PASSWORD=your_database_password


2. JWT (JSON Web Token)
Do I generate it now, and is it static forever?

The JWT_SECRET is static and should be generated once. It is used to sign and verify tokens. You can generate a strong random string using a tool like RandomKeygen or a password manager.
Example .env entry:
JWT_SECRET=supersecretkey123
JWT_EXPIRES_IN=1h

How does it work for users?

When a user logs in, the server generates a JWT using the JWT_SECRET and sends it to the user. The token is unique for each user and contains their information (e.g., user ID, role).
The token is then used for authentication in subsequent requests.


3. Google OAuth Configuration
What is it for?

Google OAuth allows users to log in using their Google accounts. It simplifies authentication and avoids the need for users to create a new password.
How do I set it up in the code?

In your .env file:
GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID=your_google_client_id
GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET=your_google_client_secret
GOOGLE_CALLBACK_URL=http://localhost:3000/api/auth/google/callback

In your code (e.g., passport.js):
GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID=your_google_client_id
GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET=your_google_client_secret
GOOGLE_CALLBACK_URL=http://localhost:3000/api/auth/google/callback


Where do I get the credentials?

Go to the Google Cloud Console, create an OAuth 2.0 credential, and copy the Client ID and Secret.


4. Email Service
Whose email is used?

Typically, the developer or organization's email is used to send system-generated emails (e.g., password resets, notifications). Users do not need to provide their email credentials.
How do I configure it?

In your .env file
EMAIL_HOST=smtp.your_email_provider.com
EMAIL_PORT=587
EMAIL_USER=your_email_address
EMAIL_PASSWORD=your_email_password

Example for Gmail:
EMAIL_HOST=smtp.gmail.com
EMAIL_PORT=587
EMAIL_USER=your_email@gmail.com
EMAIL_PASSWORD=your_app_specific_password

Where do I get the credentials?
From your email provider's documentation. For Gmail, you may need to generate an App Password.


5. Admin Account
Is it static?

Yes, the admin account is typically static and predefined during setup. You can either:
Create it in a seeder file.
Insert it manually into the database.
How do I set it up?

Example in a seeder file
const bcrypt = require('bcrypt');
const password = await bcrypt.hash('admin123', 10);

await User.create({
    email: 'admin@yourdomain.com',
    password: password,
    role: 'admin',
});

Where do I configure it?
In your database or seeders. Alternatively, you can create the admin account through an API endpoint.


7. Miscellaneous
What are these for?

These are general configuration values for your application.
Examples:
PORT=3000
NODE_ENV=development
PORT: The port your application runs on (e.g., 3000 for local development).
NODE_ENV: The environment your app is running in (development, test, or production).
Where do I configure it?

In your .env file.


Summary of What to Do
PostgreSQL: Set up the database and configure the .env file with the connection details.
JWT: Generate a static secret and add it to the .env file.
Google OAuth: Set up credentials in the Google Cloud Console and configure the .env file.
Email Service: Use your email credentials for system-generated emails.
Admin Account: Predefine it in a seeder or create it manually in the database.
Cloud Storage: Only configure if you need file uploads.
Miscellaneous: Set general app configurations like PORT and NODE_ENV.
